# Bit-Trove Project Summary

## Overview

Bit-Trove is a modern full-stack monorepo built with TypeScript, following layered architecture (clean/hexagonal architecture) and Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) principles. The project consists of a React Router frontend, NestJS backend, and shared packages for API models and UI components.

## Architecture Principles

### Layered Architecture (Clean/Hexagonal Architecture)
- **Backend**: Follows layered architecture with clear separation of domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers
- **Domain Layer**: Contains business entities, value objects, and domain services
- **Application Layer**: Orchestrates use cases and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles external concerns (database, caching, external APIs)
- **Presentation Layer**: Manages HTTP controllers and API endpoints

### Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)
- **Frontend**: Organized by FSD methodology with clear layer separation
- **Layers**: `app/`, `entities/`, `features/`, `shared/`, `widgets/`
- **Features**: Self-contained modules with their own components, hooks, and utilities
- **Entities**: Business domain objects shared across features
- **Shared**: Common utilities, UI components, and configurations
