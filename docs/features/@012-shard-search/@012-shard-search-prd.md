# Product Requirements Document: Shard Search Feature

## Introduction/Overview

This feature implements a comprehensive search functionality for shards within the BitTrove application. Users will be able to search through shards using a search dialog interface that appears when clicking the header search input. The search will be real-time with debouncing, support keyboard navigation, and provide a clean, accessible search experience.

**Problem Statement:** Users need a quick and efficient way to find specific shards within the application without navigating through multiple pages or scrolling through long lists.

**Goal:** Provide an intuitive, fast, and accessible search experience that allows users to quickly locate and navigate to relevant shards.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal:** Enable users to search shards with real-time results displayed in a search dialog
2. **Secondary Goal:** Provide a clean, keyboard-navigable search experience with proper loading states
3. **UX Goal:** Create a smooth, accessible search interface with proper error handling
4. **Performance Goal:** Implement debounced API calls with result caching for optimal performance

## User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to click the search input in the header so that I can quickly search for shards without leaving my current page.

2. **As a user**, I want to see search results as I type (after 3+ characters) so that I can find content quickly without waiting for page loads.

3. **As a user**, I want to navigate search results using keyboard arrows so that I can efficiently browse through options without using my mouse.

4. **As a user**, I want to click on a search result so that I can navigate directly to that shard and close the search dialog.

5. **As a user**, I want to see loading states during search so that I know the system is working on my request.

6. **As a user**, I want to see helpful prompts and error messages so that I understand how to use the search effectively.

## Functional Requirements

### Header Search Input
1. The header must contain a clickable search input that is not a functional search field
2. Clicking the header search input must immediately open a search dialog
3. The search dialog must be implemented using a dialog component for proper accessibility

### Search Dialog
4. The search dialog must display a search input field at the top with command icon styling
5. The search input must require a minimum of 3 characters before triggering search
6. The search input must support real-time search with debouncing (300ms recommended)
7. The search dialog must be dismissible by:
   - Clicking outside the dialog
   - Pressing the Escape key
8. The search dialog must support keyboard navigation using arrow keys
9. The search dialog must support Enter key to select highlighted results

### Search Results Display
10. Search results must show shard name, description, author, creation date, reading time, and tags
11. Results must be displayed with proper visual hierarchy and metadata
12. Each result must be clickable and navigate to the corresponding shard
13. Clicking a result must close the search dialog
14. Results must show appropriate icons and visual indicators for content type

### Loading States
15. The search must display a pending/loading state while API calls are in progress
16. Loading states must be shown in the search dialog area
17. The search input must show a loading indicator during active searches

### Error Handling
18. The search must display appropriate error messages when API calls fail
19. Error states must provide retry functionality when applicable
20. Empty state must be shown when no results are found with helpful messaging

### Search Interface Component
21. The search must use a dedicated SearchInterface component for consistent UI
22. The SearchInterface must support multiple states: prompt, loading, error, empty, and results
23. The SearchInterface must provide proper accessibility features and keyboard navigation
24. The SearchInterface must be reusable and composable for future search features

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Advanced Search Features:** No filters, sorting options, or search operators
2. **Multiple Content Types:** Search is limited to shards only (not blog posts, tags, or authors)
3. **Search Analytics:** No tracking of search patterns or analytics
4. **Search Suggestions:** No autocomplete or search suggestions
5. **Search History:** No persistent search history or recent searches
6. **Mobile-Specific Features:** No special mobile optimizations beyond responsive design
7. **Search Export:** No ability to export search results
8. **Search Permissions:** No role-based search restrictions
9. **Dedicated Search Page:** No standalone search page route

## Design Considerations

### UI Components
- Use SearchInterface component for the search dialog
- Use Dialog component for the overlay container
- Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Follow existing design system patterns and color schemes

### Accessibility
- Ensure proper ARIA labels and roles for screen readers
- Support keyboard navigation (Tab, Arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
- Maintain focus management within the dialog
- Provide clear visual feedback for loading states

### Visual Design
- Search dialog should have a clean, minimal design with command-style input
- Loading states should use consistent spinner/loading indicators
- Search results should have clear visual hierarchy with metadata
- Error and empty states should provide helpful guidance

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend Implementation
- Implement using React Server Components where possible
- Use existing shard API endpoints with search parameters
- Implement proper error handling for failed API calls
- Use React Query for caching search results

### API Integration
- Integrate with existing `useInfiniteShardsQuery` hook
- Support search parameter in shard queries
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Use debouncing to prevent excessive API calls

### State Management
- Handle loading states properly across components
- Manage dialog open/close state
- Handle search query state and validation

### Performance
- Implement debouncing (300ms) for search input
- Cache search results to reduce API calls
- Optimize re-renders using React.memo where appropriate
- Lazy load search components if needed

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement:** 80% of users who click the search input complete a search
2. **Search Completion:** 70% of searches result in a user clicking on a result
3. **Performance:** Search results load within 500ms on average
4. **Accessibility:** 100% keyboard navigation compliance
5. **Error Rate:** Less than 5% of searches result in errors

## Open Questions

1. **Debounce Timing:** Is 300ms the optimal debounce time, or should it be configurable?
2. **Result Limit:** Should there be a limit on the number of results shown?
3. **Error Handling:** What should be displayed when API calls fail or return no results?
4. **Mobile Experience:** Should the search dialog behavior differ on mobile devices?
5. **Search Parameters:** Should additional search parameters be supported (e.g., tags, author)?
