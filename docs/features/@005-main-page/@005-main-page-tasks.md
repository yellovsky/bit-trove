# Main Page Implementation Tasks

## Relevant Files

- `apps/frontend/app/pages/home/index.tsx` - Page entry point with meta tag management and HydrationBoundary
- `apps/frontend/app/pages/home/ui/HomePage.tsx` - Main page component with layout and sections
- `apps/frontend/app/pages/home/model/load-data.ts` - Server-side data loading for shards and initial blog posts
- `apps/frontend/app/shared/ui/SectionHeader.tsx` - Reusable section header component extracted from blog page
- `apps/frontend/app/shared/ui/SectionHeader.test.tsx` - Unit tests for SectionHeader component
- `apps/frontend/app/pages/home/lib/seo-utils.ts` - Home page specific SEO utilities (Open Graph, Twitter Cards, JSON-LD)
- `apps/frontend/app/pages/home/lib/seo-utils.test.ts` - Unit tests for home page SEO utilities
- `apps/frontend/app/features/blog-posts/lib/seo-utils.ts` - Blog posts specific SEO utilities
- `apps/frontend/app/features/blog-posts/lib/seo-utils.test.ts` - Unit tests for blog posts SEO utilities

### Notes

- The implementation follows Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Page components are organized in `pages/home/ui/` directory
- Data loading logic is separated into `pages/home/model/` directory
- SEO utilities are properly organized according to FSD principles:
  - **Page-specific SEO utilities** (`@pages/home/lib/seo-utils.ts`): Home page specific meta tags
  - **Feature-specific SEO utilities** (`@features/blog-posts/lib/seo-utils.ts`): Blog posts specific meta tags
- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory)
- Use `yarn test [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration
- The home page uses TanStack Query's HydrationBoundary for proper server-side rendering and client-side hydration

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Extract and Create Reusable Section Header Component
- [x] 2.0 Implement Shards Grid Section with Server-Side Loading
- [x] 3.0 Implement Blog Posts Timeline with Infinite Scroll
- [x] 4.0 Implement SEO and Meta Tags Management
- [x] 5.0 Create Main Page Layout and Responsive Design
- [x] 6.0 Reorganize SEO Utilities According to FSD Principles

## Implementation Status

All tasks have been completed successfully. The main page now features:

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper grid layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Initial content is loaded server-side for better SEO and performance
- **Client-Side Hydration**: TanStack Query's HydrationBoundary ensures smooth client-side transitions
- **SEO Optimization**: Complete meta tag implementation including Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and JSON-LD structured data
- **FSD Architecture**: SEO utilities properly organized according to Feature-Sliced Design principles:
  - Home page specific SEO utilities in `@pages/home/lib/seo-utils.ts`
  - Blog posts specific SEO utilities in `@features/blog-posts/lib/seo-utils.ts`
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation support
- **Internationalization**: Full i18n support with translation keys for all user-facing text
- **Component Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns following FSD principles

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the main page with all the required functionality from the PRD, following proper architectural patterns.
