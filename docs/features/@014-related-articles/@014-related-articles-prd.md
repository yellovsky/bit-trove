# Related Articles Endpoint - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction/Overview

The Related Articles feature provides a comprehensive system for managing and retrieving article relationships, enabling content discovery and improved user engagement. This feature allows content creators to establish meaningful connections between articles while providing end users with contextual navigation and content suggestions.

The system supports extensible relation types, bidirectional relationships, and provides a dedicated endpoint for retrieving related articles as part of the main articles API.

## Goals

1. **Content Discovery**: Enable users to discover relevant content through article relationships
2. **Engagement Improvement**: Increase user engagement by suggesting related content
3. **Content Management**: Provide content creators with tools to manage article relationships
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Create a flexible system that can accommodate future relation types
5. **Performance**: Ensure fast retrieval of related articles with efficient querying

## User Stories

### Content Creator Stories
- As a content creator, I want to create relationships between articles so that users can discover related content
- As a content creator, I want to specify the type of relationship (related, furtherReading) so that I can provide appropriate context
- As a content creator, I want to order related articles so that I can control the presentation priority
- As a content creator, I want to delete article relationships so that I can maintain content relevance

### End User Stories
- As an end user, I want to see related articles when viewing an article so that I can discover more content
- As an end user, I want to distinguish between different types of relationships (related vs furtherReading) so that I understand the content context
- As an end user, I want to see related articles efficiently so that I can browse through relationships without performance issues

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Article Relations Data Model
The system must support article relations with the following properties:
- Source article ID (required)
- Target article ID (required)
- Relation type (required, extensible enum: "related", "furtherReading")
- Order/priority (required, integer for sorting)
- Direction information (source/target context)

### 2. Related Articles Endpoint
The system must provide an endpoint that:
- Accepts an article ID as a parameter
- Returns a list of related articles
- Returns short article data suitable for UI rendering
- Includes direction information (whether the requested article is source or target)
- Supports filtering by relation type through query parameters

### 3. Database Operations for Article Relations
The system must support the following operations:
- **Create**: Add a new article relation with source, target, type, and order (via seeding)
- **Read**: List article relations with filtering
- **Delete**: Remove an article relation by ID (via database operations)

### 4. Bidirectional Relationship Handling
The system must:
- Store relationships unidirectionally (source → target)
- Automatically handle bidirectional logic in queries
- Avoid duplicate articles in responses
- Provide direction context in responses

### 5. Response Format
The system must return:
- Short article data (ID, title, slug, excerpt, etc.)
- Relation type
- Direction context (source/target)
- Order/priority information

### 6. Extensible Relation Types
The system must:
- Support initial types: "related" and "furtherReading"
- Allow future addition of new relation types
- Validate relation types against allowed values

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Updates to Relations**: The system will not support updating existing relations (only create/delete)
2. **Main Article Response Integration**: Related articles will not be included in the main article response
3. **Automatic Relationship Generation**: The system will not automatically suggest or create relationships
4. **Complex Relationship Types**: The system will not support hierarchical or conditional relationships
5. **Bulk Operations**: The system will not support bulk create/delete operations in the initial implementation
6. **Pagination**: The initial implementation does not include pagination for related articles
7. **CRUD API Endpoints**: The initial implementation focuses on read operations only

## Design Considerations

### API Endpoints Structure
- `GET /v1/articles/{id}/related` - Get related articles for a specific article

### Response Format Example
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "123",
      "article": {
        "id": "123",
        "title": "Related Article Title",
        "slug": "related-article-slug",
        "shortDescription": "Short description...",
        "publishedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "readingTime": 5
      },
      "relationType": "related",
      "direction": "source",
      "order": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema
- Uses `article_relations` table with foreign keys to articles
- Includes indexes on source_id, target_id, and relation_type for performance
- Uses composite unique constraint on (source_id, target_id, relation_type) to prevent duplicates
- Includes additional indexes for efficient querying

### Integration Points
- Reuses existing article models and DTOs for short article responses
- Integrates with existing authentication and authorization systems
- Follows established API patterns and error handling
- Uses the main articles controller for the related articles endpoint

### Performance Considerations
- Implements database indexes for efficient queries
- Uses optimized queries to avoid N+1 problems
- Considers caching for frequently accessed relationships

## Success Metrics

1. **Content Discovery**: Measure increase in article views from related article suggestions
2. **User Engagement**: Track time spent on site and article-to-article navigation
3. **Performance**: Ensure API response times remain under 200ms for related articles queries

## Open Questions

1. **Caching Strategy**: Should related articles be cached, and if so, for how long?
2. **Rate Limiting**: What rate limits should apply to relation endpoints?
3. **Future Relation Types**: What additional relation types might be needed in the future?
4. **Bulk Operations**: Will bulk operations be needed for content migration or management?
5. **Pagination**: Should pagination be added for articles with many relations?

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Database schema and basic read operations ✅
2. **Phase 2**: Related articles endpoint ✅
3. **Phase 3**: Direction handling and bidirectional logic ✅
4. **Phase 4**: Frontend integration ✅
5. **Phase 5**: Additional relation types and advanced features (future)
6. **Phase 6**: CRUD API endpoints for relation management (future)
7. **Phase 7**: Pagination support (future)
