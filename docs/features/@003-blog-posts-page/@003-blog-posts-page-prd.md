# Blog Posts Page Enhancement - Product Requirements Document

## Introduction/Overview

This feature enhances the existing blog posts page (`/blog`) to provide a comprehensive, SEO-optimized, and user-friendly experience for browsing blog posts. The page displays a responsive grid of blog post cards with infinite scrolling, proper loading states, and comprehensive SEO meta tags. The design follows IDE-like principles with terminal-style elements where applicable.

**Problem Statement**: The current blog posts page lacks proper SEO optimization, comprehensive loading states, error handling, and some user experience enhancements that would improve discoverability and usability.

**Goal**: Create a production-ready blog posts listing page that follows SEO best practices, provides excellent user experience with proper loading states, and maintains the IDE-like design aesthetic.

## Goals

1. **SEO Optimization**: Implement comprehensive meta tags including Open Graph, Twitter Cards, JSON-LD structured data, canonical URLs, and language alternates
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Add proper loading states, error handling, and empty states with engaging messaging
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the grid layout works perfectly across all device sizes
4. **Performance**: Optimize for Core Web Vitals and maintain fast loading times
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure the page meets WCAG guidelines and provides excellent keyboard navigation
6. **IDE-like Design**: Incorporate terminal-style elements where appropriate while maintaining the existing card design

## Design Considerations

### SEO Meta Tags Structure
```typescript
// Required meta tags for blog posts page
{
  title: "Blog Posts – Comprehensive Programming Articles & Tutorials",
  description: "Explore comprehensive articles, tutorials, and insights on programming, development, and technology.",
  keywords: "programming articles, development tutorials, React guides, TypeScript tips",
  canonical: "https://example.com/blog",
  robots: "index, follow, max-snippet:50",
  og: {
    title: "Blog Posts – Comprehensive Programming Articles & Tutorials",
    description: "Explore comprehensive articles, tutorials, and insights on programming, development, and technology.",
    type: "website",
    url: "https://example.com/blog",
    image: "https://example.com/og-image.jpg"
  },
  twitter: {
    card: "summary_large_image",
