# Blog Post Detail Page Enhancement - PRD

## Introduction/Overview

The blog post detail page (`/blog/:slugOrId`) currently displays basic blog post information but lacks comprehensive features for optimal user experience and SEO. This enhancement will transform it into a fully-featured blog post page that provides comprehensive information about blog posts while maintaining excellent performance and accessibility.

The current implementation shows only title, publication date, reading time, and content. This enhancement will add structured layout, enhanced SEO, better user experience, and comprehensive blog post information display.

## Goals

1. **Comprehensive Information Display**: Show all available blog post information in a well-structured, visually appealing layout
2. **Enhanced SEO**: Implement comprehensive meta tags, structured data, and breadcrumb navigation for better search engine visibility
3. **Improved User Experience**: Add reading progress indicator, table of contents, and better navigation
4. **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Ensure optimal experience across all device sizes
5. **Accessibility Compliance**: Maintain WCAG AA standards with screen reader compatibility
6. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure fast loading times and smooth interactions

## User Stories

1. **As a developer seeking technical content**, I want to see comprehensive blog post information including author, tags, and related articles so that I can understand the context and discover related content.

2. **As a general reader**, I want to easily navigate through the blog post with a table of contents and reading progress indicator so that I can track my reading progress and jump to specific sections.

3. **As a search engine crawler**, I want to find comprehensive meta tags and structured data so that the blog post appears with rich snippets in search results.

4. **As a mobile user**, I want the blog post to be fully responsive and accessible so that I can read comfortably on any device.

5. **As a user with accessibility needs**, I want the page to be screen reader compatible so that I can access the content using assistive technologies.
